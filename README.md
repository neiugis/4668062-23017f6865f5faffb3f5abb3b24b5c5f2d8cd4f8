This hexbin map shows the proximity of earthquakes (magnitude 3.0 or greater) in the Canterbury region of New Zealand during the month of September, 2010.

The map is created using [Leaflet]. The hexbin layer is a custom [Leaflet] layer which uses [d3js](d3js.org) to generate a svg hexbin overlay. The source for the custom leaflet layer is viewable [here](https://github.com/affinitybridge/d3-demos-quakes/blob/master/js/leaflet.hexbin-layer.js).

Earthquake data sourced from [GeoNet](http://www.geonet.org.nz/).
